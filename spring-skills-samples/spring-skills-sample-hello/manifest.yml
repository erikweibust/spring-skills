#
# A manifest file suitable for pushing this sample into Cloud Foundry.
# Specifically, I've tested this by pushing into Pivotal Web Services
# (PWS) at run.pivotal.io, using the following command:
#
# cf push -f manifest.yml
#
# The `random-route: true` setting ensures that the app will be assigned
# a random route, to avoid collisions with other applications deployed
# on PWS. Be sure to take note of the route assigned (it will be echoed
# in the output from the `cf` command as `urls: `). You'll need this
# route to register the application as a webhook for Alexa and Google
# DialogFlow.
