= Spring Skills

Enables development of Alexa voice interface skills with Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud Function.

== Disclaimer

At this time, this project is only an experiment and should not be considered an official project of the
Spring portfolio, nor should there be any expectation of support from the Spring team or Pivotal Software.
While I welcome suggestions, pull-requests, and bug reports, I cannot offer any promises with regard to
service-level.
