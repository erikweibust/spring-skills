= Spring Skills

Enables development of Alexa voice interface skills with Spring and Spring Boot.

The original, Spring Cloud Function-based version of Spring Skills has moved into `/attic`.
What you'll find here is a (work-in-progress) attempt at a reimagined Spring Skills that
is controller-based, allowing Spring Skills-enabled apps to be hosted anywhere (such as
run.pivotal.io) and (eventually) handle requests from both Alexa and Google Assistant. (At
the moment, I'm focusing on supporting Alexa...Google Assistant comes later.)


== Disclaimer

At this time, this project is only an experiment and should not be considered an official project of the
Spring portfolio, nor should there be any expectation of support from the Spring team or Pivotal Software.
While I welcome suggestions, pull-requests, and bug reports, I cannot offer any promises with regard to
service-level.
